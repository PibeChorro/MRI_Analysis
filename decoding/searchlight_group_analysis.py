# Before you run this script you have to have run the 
# 'decode_magic_effects_seachlight.py' script.
# The underlying rationale and methods for the analysis in this script are 
# explained in detail in Stelzer, Chen & Turner (2012)
# The data for this script is derived from an fMRI experiment in which
# subjects viewed different videos. Either magic, control or surprise videos. 
# The experiment was devided into 3 blocks. Each block consisted of 4 
# experimental runs. In each run subjects viewed 24 videos (each video is 
# considered a trial).
# The videos in each block were associated with one object (Balls, Cards and 
# Sticks) and there were 3 magic effects (Appear, Change and Vanish). For each
# magic effect and object there are two trick versions (i.e. Appear1, Appear2,
# Change1,...). This resulted in 6 magic videos per object = 18 magic videos 
# and for every magic video there was a corresponding control video showing
# the same movements without the magical effect. Additionally per object there
# were 3 surprise videos showing unusual surprising actions performed with the
# objects (e.g. eating a playing card).
# After the second run in each block the underlying method behind each magic 
# trick was presented.

#                       TIME
#   ---------------------------------->
#   OBJECT1 R1  R2  Revelation  R3  R4  |
#   OBJECT2 R1  R2  Revelation  R3  R4  |   TIME
#   OBJECT3 R1  R2  Revelation  R3  R4  v

# RUNS: 2*Appear1 Magic 2*Appear2 Magic 2*Appear1 Control 2*Appear2 Control
#       2*Vanish1 Magic 2*Vanish2 Magic 2*Vanish1 Control 2*Vanish2 Control
#       2*Change1 Magic 2*Change2 Magic 2*Change1 Control 2*Change2 Control
#       2*Surprise1     2*Surprise2     2*Surprise13
#       = 24 Videos

# The aim of the experiment was to find neural correlates of surprise and in 
# particular of surprising events we consider "impossible". 
# The data used are beta estimate NIfTI images derived from a GLM using SPM12 
# in MATLAB and is in MNI space.

# PURPOSE OF THIS SCRIPT #
##########################
# The purpose of this script is to generate a number of bootstrapped mean 
# chance accuracy maps, based on permutation maps from multiple subjects.

################################
# FUNCTIONALITY OF THIS SCRIPT #
################################
# FIRST STEP 
# Get all important path information and information about the analysis from 
# command line input.
# SECOND STEP
# From all subjects select one random permutation accuracy map and calculate 
# the mean accuracy for every voxel over the drawn permutation accuracy maps.
# Save the created mean accuracy map and repeat as often as it was stated in 
# the command line flag (10 000 in the original paper).

######################
# COMMAND LINE FLAGS #
######################
# --data: data from which previously calculated permutation tests should be 
# used. Accepted values are pre (magic effect decoding pre revelation), post
# (magic effect decoding post revelation), all (magic effect decoding using 
# pre and post revelation data), pre-post (decoding videos pre vs. post 
# revelation) and mag-nomag (decoding magic vs nomagic).
# --bootstraps: how many chance distribution maps should be created from the 
# 100 permutation maps per subject
